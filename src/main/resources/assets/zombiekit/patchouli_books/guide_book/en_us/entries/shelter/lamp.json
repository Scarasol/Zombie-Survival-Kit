That's because what zombies are actually afraid of is ultraviolet (UV) light. Knowing this, we can install some high-powered UV floodlights around the base. This way, we can ensure proper illumination"

Similarly, since they do not spontaneously combust in sunlight, this method remains ineffective against the subtype known as 'corpse shells.' Based on observations, corpse shells seem capable of identifying and attacking light sources, though the precise reason for this behavior remains unclear. Thus, it is imperative to exercise extra caution when dealing with this variant,"

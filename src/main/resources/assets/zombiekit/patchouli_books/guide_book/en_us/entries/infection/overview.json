Following the emergence of the PAX-12 mutant variant, there was a noticeable increase in spore production. These spores have begun to spread widely through aerosol transmission. Every individual has become a carrier of the fungus, and those without immunity have already fallen prey to it, which was also the direct cause of the military's collapse. "

However, the fungus would accumulate inside their bodies. When the fungal load reached a certain level, their immune systems would give in. The infection would progress slowly, and without timely intervention, it would eventually lead to zombification.'"
